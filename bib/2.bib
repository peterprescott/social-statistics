From most research on the transition to home-ownership, one gets the impression that the association between family formation and home-ownership is positive: family formation seems to speed up the process of acquiring a home in several countries. However, it has also been argued that there might be a negative association between home-ownership and family formation at the individual or household level, because the cost of home-ownership might compete with the cost of rearing children. And it has also been found that those countries in Europe with the highest levels of home-ownership are also those with the lowest fertility. The aim of this paper is to reconcile these seemingly contradicting findings on the association between home-ownership and family formation by developing a theoretical argument comprising both the micro level of individuals and households and the macro level of countries.},

After identifying the best predictors within a domain, an across-domain regression analysis was conducted to determine the predictors' relative contributions. The best predictors of youth religiosity were ethnicity and peers' church attendance during high school. Other predictors were, in order of decreasing magnitude: residence in the south, gender, religious schooling during childhood, maternal religiosity, church attendance during childhood, the importance mothers placed on childhood religious training, and an interaction variable identifying religious mothers who were very supportive. These analyses attest to the primacy of religious role models in the development of youth religiosity.},

Both minority populations are characterised by early moves into owner-occupancy. But where British-Italians typically have moved `up and out', there has been a British-Pakistani residential consolidation in a `comfort zone' where overlaying spheres of community and neighbourhood, underpinned by localised practices of cultural consumption, eventually have come to constitute a spatial and social habitus. Though policy discourse often perceives such practices as indicative of self-segregation, I will here argue that there are similarities between the British-Pakistani comfort zone and the memories of a neighbourhood-based white working-class community, articulated by White British residents.},

  abstract = {While central to early gentrification studies, the idea that social and tenure changes were inseparably linked to displacement has recently fallen out of research in the field. This has led to difficulties in the context of a recent shift in the tenure trajectory associated with gentrification. While the process has historically been linked to an increase in home ownership in the UK, the situation today is marked by the return of the private rental sector, a return associated with the rise of buy-to-let investors, the loss of social housing and quickly escalating rents. Gentrification operating in the UK today must thus be thought of as private rental-led gentrification \textendash{} transitions to private rental in the context of social upscaling. This is shown through a detailed comparison of small-area social and tenure data from the 2001 and 2011 UK Censuses. While this tenure shift has been documented in gentrifying areas over the years, little is known about its impacts on local neighbourhoods. This is a dangerous blind-spot as private rental-led gentrification is more pernicious than gentrification linked to ownership: it is currently more widespread and likely to displace poorer residents, creates commodified spaces and its production dispossesses low-income owners.},

In addressing this issue, the paper explores the development of the post war `social project' of home ownership with particular reference to mature home ownership societies such as the USA, Japan, Britain and Australia. The paper then outlines the new fault lines and fractures which have emerged in postcrisis home ownership systems and the way in which a more vigorous, financialised private landlordism has emerged from the debris of the subprime meltdown. A key argument is that in a new and more intensified process of housing commodification, the social project promise of home ownership for a previous generation has shifted to a promise of private landlordism for current generations. In summary, the social project of Keynesian-embedded liberalism has been undermined by the economic project of neoliberalism.},

  shorttitle = {Affordable Home Ownership after the Crisis},
  abstract = {Purpose \textendash{} The purpose of this paper is to explore the role of affordable home ownership in the light of the recent global financial crisis. Design/methodology/approach \textendash{} The paper draws on recent research conducted by the authors and others which included analysis of secondary data and policy documents and interviews with key stakeholders including housing associations and developers. The theoretical scope of the paper is outlined in the first section which looks at the principles behind the two main approaches to providing affordable home ownership: shared equity and shared ownership. Given continuing aspirations on the part of most households in England to become home owners, the key comparison is with the attributes of full ownership. Findings \textendash{} The paper finds that the main products share many of the attributes of full home ownership while remaining more affordable. The economic situation post-2007 made both shared ownership and shared equity more difficult. The crisis and its aftermath also suggest that there is a need to develop a more robust and longer term market in equity sharing. This could be of real significance into the longer term, especially if the availability of mortgage finance remains constrained for many years to come. The paper concludes that in the longer term, developing a range of partial tenures which provide most of the benefits of owner-occupation but which reduce risks to individual households and improve affordability in the early years is a desirable strategy. Practical implications \textendash{} There are clear implications for policy makers in other countries, notably the benefits from developing an intermediate tenure market which includes institutional equity and risk taking rather than continued large-scale reliance on debt finance. Originality/value \textendash{} Given stated governmental ambitions to meet housing aspirations, this paper clarifies how it is possible to meet an identified need for affordable home ownership products to fill the growing ``gap'' between first-time buyers who can purchase with parental help and those who have no means of achieving home ownership, even though they have the income to support such a choice.},

The population of all the islands at the 2011 census was 2,203. Scilly forms part of the ceremonial county of Cornwall, and some services are combined with those of Cornwall. However, since 1890, the islands have had a separate local authority. Since the passing of the Isles of Scilly Order 1930, this authority has had the status of a county council and today is known as the Council of the Isles of Scilly.
The adjective "Scillonian" is sometimes used for people or things related to the archipelago. The Duchy of Cornwall owns most of the freehold land on the islands. Tourism is a major part of the local economy, along with agriculture\textemdash{}particularly the production of cut flowers.},

This paper explores whether members of such groups have suffered disproportionately from those problems and have had to respond by changing their patterns of housing consumption. It concludes that densification, whereby housing is occupied at higher densities, has been a common response to the problems, but that it has been experienced more than elsewhere in neighbourhoods where members of the ethnic minority groups are concentrated.},

New mortgage equity release products reduce liquidity constraints and are regarded as promising in the context of changing welfare states. This research focuses on household strategies. It finds that housing assets play a role in households' financial planning in all countries within the study, particularly where welfare levels are low or decreasing.

  shorttitle = {Why Is Housing Tenure Associated with a Lower Risk of Admission to a Nursing or Residential Home?},
  abstract = {Background Previous research has shown that home ownership is associated with a reduced risk of admission to institutional care. The extent to which this reflects associations between wealth and health, between wealth and ability to buy in care or increased motivation to avoid admission related to policies on charging is unclear. Taking account of the value of the home, as well as housing tenure, may provide some clarification as to the relative importance of these factors. Aims To analyse the probability of admission to residential and nursing home care according to housing tenure and house value.
Methods Cox regression was used to examine the association between home ownership, house value and risk of care home admissions over 6 years of follow-up among a cohort of 51 619 people aged 65 years or older drawn from the Northern Ireland Longitudinal Study, a representative sample of z28\% of the population of Northern Ireland.
Results 4\% of the cohort (2138) was admitted during follow-up. Homeowners were less likely than those who rented to be admitted to care homes (HR 0.77, 95\% CI 0.70 to 0.85, after adjusting for age, sex, health, living arrangement and urban/rural differences). There was a strong association between house value/tenure and health with those in the highest valued houses having the lowest odds of less than good health or limiting long-term illness. However, there was no difference in probability of admission according to house value; HRs of 0.78 (95\% CI 0.67 to 0.90) and 0.81 (95\% CI 0.70 to 0.95), respectively, for the lowest and highest value houses compared with renters.
Conclusions The requirement for people in the UK with capital resources to contribute to their care is a significant disincentive to institutional admission. This may place an additional burden on carers.},

One variable now commonly adopted is zero car ownership. This paper challenges the logic of including `not having a car' as an indicator of disadvantage. It argues that this can distort the real picture of disadvantage. It presents evidence to show that zero car ownership can be a positive feature of low income households and that conversely high car ownership can put significant financial stress on households with low income.},
